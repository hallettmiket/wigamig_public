# wigamig-join.sh — the one script a prospective member runs to join a wigamig
# institution. It:
#   1. installs `age` (encryption) if you don't have it,
#   2. asks you a few questions (no file to edit),
#   3. encrypts your answers to your registrar's public key,
#   4. opens your email app, pre-addressed, with the encrypted request ready
#      to send (also saved as join-request.age and copied to your clipboard).
#
# Nothing leaves your computer until YOU press Send. Only your registrar can
# read the result.
