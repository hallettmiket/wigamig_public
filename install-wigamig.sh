#!/usr/bin/env sh
# install-wigamig.sh — one command that installs the wigamig software on your
# computer. It:
#   1. checks you have git (and installs 'uv', the Python installer, if needed),
#   2. downloads the public wigamig code to ~/repos/wigamig,
#   3. installs the `wigamig` command,
#   4. wires the shared agents + rules into ~/.claude/,
#   5. registers the wigamig hooks + tools.
#
# You do NOT need to be approved for a centre to run this — the code is public.
# This just gets your machine ready. Joining a lab/core still happens by email
# (see wigamig-join.sh) and the Mayor's reply.
#
#   Download + run:
#     curl -fsSL -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hallettmiket/wigamig_public/main/install-wigamig.sh
#     sh install-wigamig.sh
